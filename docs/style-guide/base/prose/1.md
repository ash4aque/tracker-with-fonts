header: Containers

The `.container` class is used to horizontally constrain content at the highest level. It should be used to wrap all content, ensuring that it stays within the maximum width of the page. Also includes padding on the left and right side to prevent content from resting against the edge of small screens.

In this example, the blue background on `.module` spans the width of the screen, while the `.container` inside constrains content to the target width. The `.fullwidth` class on `.module` gives the containing element a minimum width equal to our minimum page width. This prevents an issue where the background doesn't extend to the edge of the page when the browser is more narrow than the page and a user scrolls to the right.

``` html
<div class="module fullwidth" style="background: blue;">
  <div class="container">
    <p>Content goes here.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `.container` can be the top level element because there is no background (or border, or other visual treatment) that must span the screen outside of the width of the container.


``` html
<div class="container">
  <p>Content without a background goes here.</p>
</div>
```
