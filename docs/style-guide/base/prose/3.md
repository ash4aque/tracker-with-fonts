header: Modules and Margins

To move individual elements or components around the page without the use of the grid system, prefer `margin-top` for vertical spacing and `margin-left` for horizontal spacing.

### Vertical Margins

To minimize issues with collapsing margins and to normalize spacing, block level elements include `margin-top` without `margin-bottom`. This ensures even padding on the bottom of content areas (unaffected by element or component margins), and allows us to remove the margin from the first element or component in a module with a `:first-child` selector, making it easy to add padding to a content area without the content affecting adding additional space.

#### Modules

To facilitate this, we add the `.module` class to content containers. This class removes the `margin-top` from the first element in a module, ensuring even spacing. The `.module` class can be applied to elements with other classes and styles freely.

### Horizontal Margins

When spacing elements horizontally, apply `margin-left` instead of `margin-right` and remove the margin from the first element with `:first-child`.

If a collection of horizontal elements should wrap but should not be built with the grid system, do not remove `margin-left` from the first child, but apply a negative margin equal to the `margin-left` to the container element.

``` styl
.example-list {
  margin-left: -24px;

  li {
    margin-left: 24px;
  }
}
```

``` html
<ul class="example-list">
  <li>Example List Item 1</li>
  <li>Example List Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

If the container element has its own styles, it may be necessary to add an additional wrapper with the negative margin inside of the parent.
